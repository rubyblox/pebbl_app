<!--
rng schema locating file for the GTK UI builder schema

for use with Emacs nxml-mode and other editors supporting the
schema locatingRules syntax

to fetch gtkbuilder.rnc, in shell:
$ rake -C ../ uischema

Assuming:
1) that the Emacs Lisp variable `rng-schema-locating-files' includes
   the string "schemas.xml" or an absolute pathname to this file
2) that the file gtkbuilder.rnc has been retrieved

... then Emacs should be able to locate gtkbuilder.rnc
    for all GtkBuilder UI files in this directory

This may be useful for Emacs users, when editing GTk menu definitions
outside of the Glade UI builder, or for custom edits on GtkBuilder UI
files edited with the Glade UI builder.
