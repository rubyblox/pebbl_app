## utility script for showing library dependencies from the host
## packaging system, on SUSE platforms
##
## this integrates with the show_depends_libs task in the project's
## Rakefile.
##
## this script should be run from the project's working directory
##
## usage: ./bin/show-depends-suse
##
## Rationale:
## - Illustrates library => package dependencies, after a succesful
##   bundler installation on SUSE platforms
## - Utility script, pusuant towards documentation updates
##
## Assumptions:
## - that this shell script is run after 'bundle install'
##   from within the project working directory
## - that all dependencies are installed on the host
## - that the host is running a SUSE Linux OS
